# Authorized Web Vulnerability Scanner

A legitimate penetration testing tool designed for authorized security assessments of web applications. This scanner performs various security checks including directory enumeration, HTTP header analysis, SSL/TLS configuration assessment, and common vulnerability detection.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è LEGAL DISCLAIMER

**This tool is for authorized security testing ONLY.** You must:
- Own the target system, OR
- Have explicit written permission from the system owner

Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical. The developers are not responsible for misuse of this tool.

## Features

- **Security Header Analysis**: Checks for missing or misconfigured security headers
- **SSL/TLS Assessment**: Analyzes SSL certificate and configuration
- **Directory Enumeration**: Discovers common directories and files
- **Common Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies potential security issues
- **Multi-threaded Scanning**: Concurrent requests for faster scanning
- **JSON Output**: Structured results for further analysis
- **Customizable Scans**: Basic or full scan modes

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Internet connection for target scanning

   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests urllib3
   ```

   Or install from requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Make the script executable** (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x web_vuln_scanner.py
   ```

### Dependencies

The script uses the following Python packages:
- `requests`: For HTTP requests
- `urllib3`: For advanced HTTP functionality
- Standard library modules: `argparse`, `json`, `ssl`, `socket`, `threading`, `concurrent.futures`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python web_vuln_scanner.py -u https://example.com --confirm
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Full scan with custom threading and output
python web_vuln_scanner.py -u https://example.com --scan-type full --threads 10 --output results.json --confirm

# Basic scan with custom timeout
python web_vuln_scanner.py -u http://testsite.local --timeout 15 --confirm
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Short | Required | Description |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `--url` | `-u` | Yes | Target URL to scan |
| `--output` | `-o` | No | Output file for results (JSON format) |
| `--scan-type` | | No | Type of scan: `basic` or `full` (default: basic) |
| `--threads` | | No | Number of concurrent threads (default: 5, max: 50) |
| `--timeout` | | No | Request timeout in seconds (default: 10, max: 60) |
| `--confirm` | | Yes | Confirm authorization to test target |

### Scan Types

- **Basic Scan**: Security headers, SSL analysis, common vulnerabilities
- **Full Scan**: All basic checks plus directory enumeration

## Output

The scanner provides color-coded console output:
- üî¥ **HIGH**: Critical security issues
- üü° **MEDIUM**: Important security concerns
- üü¢ **LOW**: Minor security improvements
- üîµ **INFO**: General information

### Sample Output

```
Starting basic vulnerability scan on https://example.com
Scan started at: 2024-01-15 10:30:00
============================================================

[INFO] Analyzing security headers for https://example.com
[MEDIUM] Security Headers: Missing security headers: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
[LOW] Information Disclosure: Server information disclosed: Server: nginx/1.18.0

[INFO] Analyzing SSL/TLS configuration
[INFO] SSL Configuration: TLS Version: TLSv1.3, Cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

[INFO] Checking for common vulnerabilities
[MEDIUM] Clickjacking: No X-Frame-Options header found - potential clickjacking vulnerability

============================================================
Scan completed in 3.45 seconds
Total findings: 3
Results saved to: results.json
```

### JSON Output Format

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:01.123456",
    "severity": "MEDIUM",
    "category": "Security Headers",
    "message": "Missing security headers: X-Content-Type-Options",
    "target": "https://example.com",
    "details": {
      "missing_headers": ["X-Content-Type-Options"]
    }
  }
]
```

## Security Checks Performed

### 1. HTTP Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

### 2. SSL/TLS Configuration
- Certificate expiration
- TLS version
- Cipher suite analysis
- Certificate chain validation

### 3. Information Disclosure
- Server headers
- Technology stack disclosure
- Version information

### 4. Directory Enumeration (Full Scan)
- Admin panels
- Backup files
- Configuration files
- Development directories
- API endpoints

### 5. Common Vulnerabilities
- Clickjacking protection
- Accessible backup files
- Configuration file exposure

## Examples

### Testing a Local Development Server
```bash
python web_vuln_scanner.py -u http://localhost:8080 --confirm
```

### Comprehensive Scan with Results Export
```bash
python web_vuln_scanner.py \
  -u https://your-authorized-target.com \
  --scan-type full \
  --threads 15 \
  --timeout 20 \
  --output security_assessment.json \
  --confirm
```

### Quick Security Header Check
```bash
python web_vuln_scanner.py -u https://example.com --scan-type basic --confirm
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always obtain proper authorization** before scanning
2. **Use reasonable thread counts** to avoid overwhelming the target
3. **Respect rate limits** and implement delays if needed
4. **Save results** for documentation and tracking
5. **Combine with other tools** for comprehensive assessment

## Limitations

- **Authentication**: Does not handle authenticated sessions
- **Complex Vulnerabilities**: May not detect application-specific issues
- **False Positives**: Manual verification of findings is recommended
- **Rate Limiting**: May be blocked by WAFs or rate limiting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Timeouts**:
   - Increase timeout value with `--timeout`
   - Reduce thread count with `--threads`

2. **SSL Certificate Errors**:
   - The scanner accepts self-signed certificates for testing
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Permission Denied**:
   - Ensure you have proper authorization
   - Some endpoints may require authentication

### Error Messages

- `Invalid URL format`: Check URL syntax (include http:// or https://)
- `Unable to connect to target`: Verify target is accessible
- `Thread count must be between 1 and 50`: Adjust --threads parameter
