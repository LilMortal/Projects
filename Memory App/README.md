4. **Add real-time sync** with WebSockets or polling

### Adding New Features

Some ideas for extending the app:

- **Sharing**: Share memories with friends and family
- **Collaboration**: Allow multiple people to contribute to memory collections
- **Geolocation**: Automatic location detection using browser APIs
- **Voice Notes**: Add audio recordings to memories
- **Timeline View**: Horizontal scrolling timeline of memories
- **Memory Books**: Group related memories into collections
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with fuzzy matching
- **Data Sync**: Cloud synchronization across devices

### Customizing the Design

The app uses a comprehensive design system that's easy to customize:

1. **Colors**: Modify the color palette in `tailwind.config.js`
